        Editing footprints
    </h2>
    <p>
        After including the component a red cross appears. This means the reel can't be placed. To edit the settings of
        the footprint double click on the reel or select the reel in the upper list and click on the Edit button.
        The following form should appear.

        A short explanation of the settings will be given.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Part Number:</b> Manufacturer part number of the component/reel (or the name you want to give to the
            footprint). You can enter a different part number to load it from the database (if you know a part number
            with similar settings) or change the part number of the selected reel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Length:</b> Length of the footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Width:</b> Width of the footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Height:</b> Height of the footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rotation: see below!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Stack type:</b> Stack type of the reel (reel 8mm, reel 12mm, reel 16mm or the tray).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Nozzle:</b> Nozzle that the machine needs to use to pick up the component.
            See <a href="tm220a_manual.pdf#page=21">the manual</a> for more info.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Offset stack:</b> Stack offset of the component. for more in look at
            <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/TM220A_Pick_and_Place_resources#Placement_file_format"> this helpful page on
                dangerousprototypes</a>.<br>
            When you use the <strong>tray</strong>, place the component in the <strong>upper left corner</strong>. A
            prediction for the middle of the component is made based on the width and the length of the footprint. You
            can use the offset settings to correct small mistakes. Equation for determination of the middle is found
            experimental.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Feed rate:</b> Feed rate of the reel. This is the distance between two components on the reel.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you are done you just have to click on the save button and the footprint is saved in the database (same
        counts for when you change parameters of an existing footprint). The changes you made apply to all reels with
        the same manufacturer part number (except for changing the part number itself, that's only applied to the
        specific reel). Be careful with the rotation!

    <h3>
        Rotation
    </h3>
    <p>
        When you draw a component in your CAD program you probably didn't think about it's position in a reel. The
        rotation parameter of a footprint is the angle (measured CCW) between the position of the component in the reel
        and the footprint you made in your CAD program. Sounds difficult? Don't worry here is an explanation with
        images.<br>
        A diode sits in a reel with it's cathode at the top. Like in the first image. When your footprint is not drawn
        with the cathode facing upwards, or your CAD program doesn't use the Y axis as 0°, then there is a rotation to
        compensate.

        <strong>It is recommended that you check this parameter every time, maybe you used last time an other footprint
            in your CAD program with an other rotation</strong>
