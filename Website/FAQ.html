    <h2>
        Q: Why is the program sometimes in my language and sometimes in English?
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>A:</b> The program is writen using C# .net libraries. Some controls of those libraries change depending on
        the local culture. The program itself is writen in English. When you get an error in your own language the error
        comes from the C# .net libraries.

        Q: Are there going to be more machines added to the program?
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>A:</b> Maybe, if you want to add a new machine then you can find the instructions
        <a href="NewMachine.html">here.</a> You can always send us your code and if we think it is good (not buggy and
        according to the rules of OoP) then we add it to the software and put your name in the credits!
