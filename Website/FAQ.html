    FAQ
</h1>
<div>
    <h2>
        Q: Why is the program sometimes in my language and sometimes in English?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A: The program is writen using C# .net libraries. Some controls of those libraries change depending on the local
        culture. The program itself is writen in English.When you get an error in your own language the error comes from
        the C# .net libraries.

    <h2>
        Q: Does the software work on Mac?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A: Never tested, feel free to test and report it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Q: Are there going to be more machines added to the program?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A: Maybe, if you want to add a new machine then you can find the instructions
        <a href="NewMachine.html">here.</a> You can always send us your code and if we think it is good (not buggy and
        according to the rules of OoP) then we add it to the software and put your name in the credits!
