        When you start this program it automatically loads the database. On the right you have 6 buttons:

            <b>Import:</b> You can import footprints from an other database. If you click on the button the program will
            ask you to select the database to import from.All footprints in the other database that have a manufacturer
            part number that is not in yours will be copied to your database.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This operation can take some time. You can follow the progress in the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Filter:</b> Filter the displayed footprints. A pop-up window will show up.

    <h2>
        Using SQlite
    </h2>
    <p>
        The database is made with <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a> (recommended).
        There is also an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">add-on version for
        firefox.</a>
        The database is located under the same folder as the program and is called pnpFootprints.db.
        DB Browser for SQLite gives you access to the complete database. Be careful that you don't break it.
