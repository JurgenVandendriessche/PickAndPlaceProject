    Generating files from CAD program
</h1>
<div>
    <h2>
        Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
        The pick and place program needs 2 files in order to work: one pick and place file (PNP file) and one bill of
        material (BOM file). In this tutorial/manual an Altium designer project will be used to demonstrate the
        principles.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Manufacturer part number
    </h2>
    <p>
        The first step when exporting files is assigning manufacturer part numbers to the components.
        In Altium designer this is done by adding a parameter to the schematic component.
        It is important that all schematic components have the same parameter name (case sensitive), in this
        "Manufacturer Part Number" is used as parameter name. You can also use something else e.g. "mpn", "part number",
        "flupke",...
    </p>

        <p>
            <strong>TIP:</strong> You don't need to add a new parameter, you can also use an existing one like the
            library footprint name.
            This is not recommended and can lead to problems later on. However it can save time when done properly.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2>
        Origin
    </h2>
    <p>
        The location of the origin is very important for the machine. The origin should be located in the left bottom
        corner of your PCB.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Exporting the files
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>TO DO: check circuit maker -> output job </strong><br>
        Now you can finally start exporting the files. The easiest way to do this is with a output job. First you need
        to add a output job file to your project.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the <strong>File » New » Output Job File</strong> command
        </li>
        <li>
            Right-clicking on the project name in the <strong>Projects</strong> panel and choosing <strong>Add New to
            Project » Output Job File</strong> from the pop-up menu that appears.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images/Add_OutputJobFile.png">
    <p>
        Now you need to add both the PNP file and BOM file. First you are going to add the PNP file:<br>
        <strong>Assembly Outputs >> Add new Assembly Output >> Generates pick and place files >> [PCB DOCUMENT]</strong>
        If you have multiple PCBs you can also specify which one to export.
        <br><strong>TO DO: Check if this is true</strong>
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Add_PickAndPlaceFile.png">
    <p>
        Now Altium will create a pick and place file that the program can understand. If something goes wrong and
        you
        want to check if the problem is within the PNP file (or you want us to inspect it to find bugs in the
        program)
        then you might want to change the settings of the file. You can change the settings by double clicking on
        the
        newly added file. The following settings are recommended:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Formats: CSV (don't forget disabling Text or you get the pick and place file twice).
        </li>
        <li>
            Units: Metric.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images/PickAndPlaceFileSettings.png">
    <p>
        Now you need to add the BOM file:<br>
        <strong>Report Outputs >> Bill of Materials >> [Project]</strong><br>
        It is important that you select [Project], otherwise you won't have all components in the file (you selected
        a
        schematic file) or you can't add the manufacturer part numbers to the components (you selected a PcbDoc).
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Add_BomFile.png">
    <p>
        Now the BOM file needs to be configured. Unlike the PNP file this is mandatory. Double click on the BOM
        file.
        You need to do change 2 things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Designator:</b> On the left side make sure that the designator parameter is enabled. If you disable
            this
            parameter the program will not be able to link the locations from the PNP file to the manufacturer part
            numbers of the BOM file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manufacturer part number:</b> on the left side scroll down and make sure that manufacturer part
            number is
            enabled (or whatever you named the parameter before).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>File format:</b> under Export options change the file format to CSV (Comma Delimited)(*.csv).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images/BomFileSettings.png">
    <p>
        Now all you have to do is exporting the files: first select Folder structure under Output Containers and
        then
        enable the two files (2 green arrows should appear see image below). Now you just have to click on the
        Generate
        content button and you are finished.
        The two files are located under your project folder >> "Project Outputs for..." >> "BOM" / "Pick Place".
    </p>

    <div class="message info">
        <p>
            <strong>TIP:</strong> The output job file saves all the settings so when you need to remake the PNP file
            or
            BOM file you just have to do the click on the Generate content button.
