        program before exporting the first PCB and now you need that same setup again (or part of the setup).You load
        your files all footprints are known of course everything goes great and then you click on the generate button
        but the reels aren't in the right order. Good news, you can load your previous setup again. in 2 simple steps.

        <li>
            Click on the <strong>Load stack configuration button</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to the exported file from your previous PCB and open it.
