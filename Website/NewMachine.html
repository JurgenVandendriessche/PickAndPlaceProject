    How to add a new machine to the software?
</h1>
<div>
    <h2>
        Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
        The latest version of the source code can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/JurgenVandendriessche/PickAndPlaceProject">GitHub.</a><br>
        The XML documentation in the example code on this page is wrong:
        <a href="https://github.com/google/code-prettify">prettify</a> replaces the XML tags by blank spaces.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The class itself
    </h2>
    <p>
        The software is free for modifications, if you want to add a new machine you can do so. However, not all
        machines can be added to the software (e.g. adding a machine with vision system will be very difficult/
        impossible).<br>
        There are 3 distinct situations: a machine from the TM family with two nozzles, a machine with two nozzles or a
        machine with 1 nozzle, or more than two nozzles.
    </p>
    <h2>Machine from the TM family with two nozzles:</h2>
    <p>
        This is very simple:
        Make a new class that has te same name as the machine (in the code the class has the name TM2X0A), copy this
        code and fill in the '<b>?</b>' with the values for the new machine.<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
namespace PickAndPlace
{
    /// summary
    /// Represents a Neoden TM2X0A pick and place machine
    /// /summary
    public class TM2X0A : ATmMachine
    {
        private const int width_ = ?;
        private const int length_ = ?;

        private const int reels8mm_ = ?;
        private const int reels12mm_ = ?;
        private const int reels16mm_ = ?;

        /// summary
        /// Initializes a new PickAndPlace.ATmMachine with the settings of a PickAndPlace.TM2X0A
        /// /summary
        public TM2X0A()
            : base(reels8mm_, reels12mm_, reels16mm_, width_, length_) { }
    }
}</pre>
    <h2>
        Machine with two nozzles:
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a lot harder then adding a TM family machine, if the machine has 4 nozzles you have to inherit the
        IMachine interface and implement it completely. It is possible that you have to make some small changes to the
        settings form (if you need a COM port for example that you automatically search for the port).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        A machine that has one nozzle or more than two nozzles
    </h3>
    <p>
        In this case you will need to do the previous step and something extra: the settings form needs an update.
        The settings form is the only place in the software that does not change depending on the machine. More
        specifically the nozzle settings. This are the steps you have to follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a new user control for managing <strong>one</strong> nozzle setting. Use panels and DockStyle,
            otherwise it's not going to work on linux.
        </li>
        <li>In the code of the settings form class you find these lines of code:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
public SettingsForm()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    Type[] machineTypes = { typeof(TM220A), typeof(TM240A) }; //Add new machine types here
    cbxMachine.Items.AddRange(machineTypes);
    cbxMachine.DisplayMember = "Name";

    cbxNozzle1.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Nozzle));
    cbxNozzle2.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Nozzle));

    dgPnpFilePara.DefaultCellStyle.SelectionForeColor = dgPnpFilePara.DefaultCellStyle.ForeColor;
    dgBomFilePara.DefaultCellStyle.SelectionForeColor = dgBomFilePara.DefaultCellStyle.ForeColor;
}</pre>
            Remove the these two lines of code:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
cbxNozzle1.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Nozzle));
cbxNozzle2.DataSource = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Nozzle));</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a new function that adds your newly created nozzles to the form and call that function from the two
            lines you deleted in step 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            After that line, not before you add a this line of code:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">cbxMachine.SelectedIndexChanged+=cbxMachine_SelectedIndexChanged;</pre>
            The event handler needs to do at least two things:<br>
            - Delete the old Nozzle User Controls.<br>
            - Call the function to create the new ones.<br>
            - optional: pass the nozzles from the old to the new (if you go from 3 nozzles to 2 nozzles that the first
            two nozzles stay the same).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Why isn't it implemented: during development there where only 2 places with problems when I tried the software
        on linux:<br>
        1) Connecting to the database.<br>
        2) GUI elements that where not drawn correctly.<br>
        I will maybe (if I have time and enthusiasm) implement this part of the software AFTER I defended my bachelor
        test, this is optional (low priority)<br>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Compiling the project
    </h2>
    <p>
        In order to compile the project you may need to change some settings and move some files around.<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose witch platform you want (x86 /x64). Make sure that both the library and the main exe project are
            targeting the same platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            Replace Sqlite3.dll in PickAndPlaceLib.dll by the version for the platform you are targeting. You can find
            the dll file in the folders of the library project (X86 and x64) or download the most recent precompiled
            libraries from <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">Sqlite.</a> (Linux doesn't need sqlite3.dll).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you only wan't to target windows, you can use the nuget package from sqlite, but you wil need to change some
        functions in the DatabaseOperations.cs file (function names are the same, but have other capitals).
