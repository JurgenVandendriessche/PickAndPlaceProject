        File settings
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the settings form you can manage the settings for your machine, your project and the settings for reading the
        PNP file and BOM file. Lets start on the left with the machine settings. The first table contains the the
        parameters and the values for reading PNP files. If you use Altium or CircuitMaker then these are correct.
        The second table contains the settings for reading the BOM file. The first parameter is used to find the column
        in the BOM that contains the designators, the program links these designators to the designators in the PNP
        file so be careful when you change it.<br>
        <strong>manufacturer part number:</strong> This parameter must have the same value as the <strong>name of the
        parameter</strong> you used in your CAD program as manufacturer part number (e.g. "mpn", "part number",
        "flupke",...)
    </p>
    <h3>
        Machine settings
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Machine:</b> The machine you are going to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Speed:</b> Default speed (will be set for all reels later).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Nozzle1/ Nozzle2:</b> Equipped nozzles of the machine. Numbers correspond with the numbers on the
            machine.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="message warning">
        <p>
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> You can change these settings at any moment, however if you have already
            filled
            stacks, they will reset and your progress will be lost.

    <h3>
        Project settings:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Project folder:</b> Folder where the exported files for the machine are stored.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Project name:</b> Name of the exported file. If export all is pressed, the files will be named
            ProjectName_PhaseNumber (e.g. "Tutorial_Phase_1", "Tutorial_Phase_2",...).
        </li>

    <h2>
        Offset and panelization
    </h2>
    <img src="./images/Offset.png">
    <p>
        The offset and panelization are settings that can be changed at any stage without consequences.
        A short explanation of the different settings will be given here. For more details see
        <a href="tm220a_manual.pdf#page=14">the manual</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Offset Origin:</b> PCB origin compared to the origin of the machine.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Number of boards:</b> The number of boards that are placed at once on the machine.
            X is horizontal, Y is vertical
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Distance between two boards:</b> This is the distance between two boards when you use panelization.
            When the boards lay next to each other this distance is 0.
            You can ignore this setting when there is no panelization.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Board dimensions:</b> Width and length of the PCB. These dimensions are used for calculating both the
            position of the boards if there is panelization and <strong>the location of components on the bottom
            layer.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

        Loading files
    </h2>
    <img src="./images/Main_1.png">
    <p>
        For loading the files you just need to click on the button Browse and select the either the PNP file or the BOM
        file. You can also enter the path to the file in the textbox directly. When both paths are defined, you can
        click on the start button. The program will read the two files, find equivalent components together and make
        reels from them. Footprints with a known manufacturer part number are loaded from the database, and the
        corresponding reel is checked whether it can be placed by the machine or not. If the reel can be placed it will
        show up in the upper list (included). If the reel can't be placed or the footprint is unknown it will be placed
        in the lower list (excluded).
