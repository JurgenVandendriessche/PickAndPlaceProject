    <div id="update_1.3">
        <h2>Version 1.3</h2>
        <p>
            This is the actual first version of the software, older distributions where trials for distribution.<br>
            In the future the patch notes will be bigger: changes between last version and this version were not written
            down.<br>
            Another plan for the future is to make some YouTube video's
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT2JcFVnXWw&list=PLwGeijh6Y-MtXkVtfJemdOsh-c5lkvc2N">like Neoden
                did for the machine.</a><br>
            And a next patch wil replace the cryptic error messages with something more understandable.
        </p>
